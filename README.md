Strack, B., DeShazo, J. P., Gennings, C., Olmo, J. L., Ventura, S., Cios, K. J., & Clore, J. N. (2014). Impact of HbA1c measurement on hospital readmission rates: analysis of 70,000 clinical database patient records. BioMed research international, 2014.
 
The focus is on patient with diabetes.
The goal is to identify factors that led to early readmission of patients that were hospitalized.
